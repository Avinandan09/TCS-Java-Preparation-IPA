There is no predefined set method in java but there is an library in java that can be used as a set like in python.

We can use HashSet  in java which is a part of java.util package.
It also can defined as LinkedHashSet

There are some of key deference :
1->HashSet does not maintain any order of insertion
1->LinkedHashSet maintain the order of insertion

2->Its quite complex to iterate through loop in 
2->Its easy to iterate with any of the looping fn in java

The process of using it:
1. Import the java.util package.
2. Create a HashSet object.
3. Add elements to the set using add() method.
4. Use the contains() method to check if an element is in the set.
5. Use the remove() method to remove an element from the set.

Example:
    will be in the codes;
